     <p>Chicken breasts are the classic lean muscle-building protein. Don’t get stuck in the monotony of eating them bland and baked day in and day out, though. You can shred cooked chicken breast with two forks and toss it in a vinegar-based/East Carolina style BBQ sauce for a brand new flavor without a ton of extra calories.Chicken breasts are the classic lean muscle-building protein.

     <p>Egg Curry ranks high on my list of comfort foods. It is my go-to dish when I want a non-vegetarian meal but don't have any meat, chicken or fish in the house.
